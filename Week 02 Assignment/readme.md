# **Week Two Assignment**

## * Introduction *

I had a very hard time with small errors this week. Specifically, being able to push to my GitHub repository from SourceTree. I kept thinking that I could publish my repository straight from SourceTree, this however did not work. Once I figured out that I needed to create a repository online before I could push to it everything went very smoothly for me. Some resources I used for to figure out the problems I had this week are:

1. Fellow Students
2. The forums on [Atlassian](https://answers.atlassian.com/)
3. Typing a question in the https://github.com/ search engine

We were introduced to some new applications this week, which included:
- GitHub
- SourceTree
- Atom

I found it very interesting how these programs were able to communicate between each other and updated so fast after I made changes to the documents I was working on. I find using the Powershell on my Windows system to be extremely hard to learn however, I did like working with the command prompt on SourceTree. I was able to see what work I had yet to do using commands like:`git status`, `git init`, and `git commit`.

I helped out my fellow students as much as I could by replying to @gordonty's issue.

I ended up with a readme.md file that looks like; ![ my screenshot ](capture.png)
