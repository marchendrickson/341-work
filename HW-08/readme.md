### Marc Hendrickson Sec:50

# **Assignment 8**
## Overview

These two weeks were a little hectic for me because of the break, which is probably very similar to the experiences my classmates had. However, I was able to read the material and start on my website while I was traveling from airport to airport. I was constantly checking my work just by previewing it in the browser. Everything seemed like it was going very smoothly and I was not having any trouble at all. This was the case until I pushed all of my work to GitHub.

## Problem Solving

Once I pushed all of my files to GitHub I ran into a road block. My style was not working, so I tried to look online why it was not working and wet to many different websites and forums. I ended up rewriting a lot of the html code multiple times to try and fix why my internal links to my style and font pages however, I could still not solve the problem. Like many problems I have solved inn this class I had to take some time off from it in order to clear my head. This past sunday I opened the file again and decided to have another crack at fixing it. It ended up being that my links to my style.css and font.css were incorrect as well as in the wrong order. I ended up realizing that my folder name was CSS in capitals and that I had to put my style.css first in my html code and the font.css link after it. After I figured this out everything works just fine and I think that I have a cool and usable site that explains my recent trip to Canyonlands National Park.

## Important Things I have learned

1. It is very important to make sure your file names are correct including CAPITALIZATION!!
2. The order at which you place the style and font files are Important
3. The color of your website is very important in relaying the message, and can detract from the information if you are not careful with your choice.
4. It is very important for me to take breaks and not to cram all of my work into one session

## Future

I am very excited that we are now learning how to use style in our websites. I love that they are now starting to look somewhat professional and I am now proud to show them to people. I cannot wait to learn more and spend a longer time creating a site that looks and feels like some of the websites that I visit each day like: [Bikepacking](http://www.bikepacking.com).
