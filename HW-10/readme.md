## Problems

This week was a lot of material to cover, and I thought that I was understanding
the material. However, I got ahead of myself and started out by writing a fairly
complex html code first. When I started to style the website I could not keep track
of my 'div' classes and tried for a couple hours to make the website easily viewable
on a small screen. After I made it viewable on a small screen I could not for the life
of me figure out how to rearrange my content to make it flow into a larger layout.
I ended up scrapping all of my work and starting over.

When I started over I decided to keep everything really simple. I only put in a single
word for each 'div' and then created my layout for each breakpoint. After I liked
my layout for each breakpoint I then filled in the classes with extra info. This was
the way to go, I should've followed the email you sent from the beginning
and kept everything simple and then worked my way up to more complex html code.

## Conclusion

I am having fun creating these responsive websites. I am also getting to the point
where if something goes wrong I can problem shoot and work through it. I am looking
forward to creating my final website, I have talked to Jeanine Wirth, my career/resume coach,
and her website is in dire need of updating. I think that I will try to work with her on
updating/creating a new website for her company for my final project. If it seems like too daunting of a task to do before the semester ends I will continue working with her through the summer. I am also looking to further my learning over the summer and I think I will either enroll in a coding bootcamp or signing up for the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). While, I may not be looking for a job that has me coding, I am starting to recognize how important it is to at least have some understanding of the different languages.
