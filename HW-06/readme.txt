## Work

Building a website with multiple pages and multiple media elements in it proved
to be very time consuming. I did not run into many problems while writing the
code, however I did not pay attention to how large my video and images were.
This proved to be an egregious mistake when I tried to push my website to GitHub.
When I tried to push the entire project to GitHub it not only took around a half
hour to complete the process but once it finished the files were too large to be
hosted by the site. To fix this I made the file sizes smaller and then tried to
push it again, however it did not work again as my files were not small enough
again.

Once I decided to use another smaller video I was able to quickly fix my coding
and then try to push it to GitHub again. However, I soon realized that SourceTree
was still trying to push the first two videos as well as my final video. To fix
I ended up reading a tutorial on how to un-commit the files I did not want to push
into my website. Other than that small setback this week went pretty smooth, even
though it took me a while to work on the code.

## Future

I like being able to make a website that shows more of what I like to do personally.
I am very excited to learn how to put more style into my websites so that they look
more professional and up to date. I was not able to help out any of my fellow
classmates this week, it does not seem like there has been many issues people have
posted, but I will keep checking back in to see if any arise that I can help with.
