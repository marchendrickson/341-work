    The purpose of this site is to show some of the places that are accessible
    to backcountry ski around Missoula. Some places have short drive times and
    long approaches while others have long drive times and short approaches. I
    am going to include just a short sample video of where I have skied so far
    this winter and at the end maybe you can send me a video of where you have
    skied.
