    <p> When skiing in the backcountry it is extremely important that you have
      knowledge of the snowpack and other dangers associated with skiing. Avalanches
      are a very real concern wherever you may ski in the backcountry. With some classes
      and a mentor you may mitigate these risks that are inherent to backcountry
      travel.</p>
    <p>This video is just a starting point that you may use to get to know the
      dangers and freedom that exist with backcountry skiing</p>
