# **Week Four Assignment**

## * Overview *

I am definitely getting the hang of and remembering all the steps an commands we
 are working on. Working with Atom and SourceTree has really become send nature,
 although I do think the hardest part was to create the repository in the first
 place. I also tried to complete more tasks using Powershell, which is
 definitely pretty hard to remember all of the specific commands. However, the
 [GitHub website](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/powershell-beginners-guide.md)
 I found during the first week has been an extremely good reference so that I
 have my most used commands in front of me in case I forget.

 I also enjoyed the Wayback Machine, I have been visiting Archive.org for a
 number of years. I really like how much free material, like books and music
  you can get from that site.

## * Wayback Machine and Website "Snooping"*

For the first website to "snoop" at the code I chose the to look at
[NOAA.gov](http://www.noaa.gov). I thought that since it looks like a pretty
website it might have simple code that I could understand. However, I quickly
realized that I was wrong. Just the intro to the actual code that shows up on
the regular screen was longer than the code I wrote for this week's assignment.
I did however find some code that I knew, it only took about 4-5 minutes looking
the rest of the code which still looks like gibberish to me. (noaa screenshot)[https://github.com/marchendrickson/341-work/blob/master/HW-04/Noaa_Screensht.PNG]
