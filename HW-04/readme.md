# **Week Four Assignment**

## * Overview *

I am definitely getting the hang of and remembering all the steps an commands we
 are working on. Working with Atom and SourceTree has really become send nature,
 although I do think the hardest part was to create the repository in the first
 place. I also tried to complete more tasks using Powershell, which is
 definitely pretty hard to remember all of the specific commands. However, the
 [GitHub website](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/powershell-beginners-guide.md)
 I found during the first week has been an extremely good reference so that I
 have my most used commands in front of me in case I forget.

 I also enjoyed the Wayback Machine, I have been visiting Archive.org for a
 number of years. I really like how much free material, like books and music
  you can get from that site.
