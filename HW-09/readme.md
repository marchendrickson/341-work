### Marc Hendrickson Sec: 50

# **Assignment 09 **

## Overview

This week seemed to go very smoothly for me, except for the idea of a professional
looking website. I originally made a website that I liked the idea of but I could not
pick out a good color pallet or good typography. So instead of working on that website
I decided to make one where I pretended to be a business owner and was able to make it
look professional, in my eyes at least.

## Problems

The only problem this week I had was to get my dropdown menu to work. The menu kept on
being visible when the webpage loaded. I read through a lot of material and none of it
seemed to work. I then was able to read through [w3 school's](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp) webpage about dropdown menus
and do the 'Try it yourself' tutorials and it started to make more sense. The only thing
that bugged me was why in the HTML code you had to include the javascript element:
`<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="dropbtn">` I used it even though we haven't learned
that but it was the only code that was different from w3 school's and mine.

## Future
This week I really understood how hard it is to choose a color pallet as well as the right
font for your website to look professional. The first website I was going to create I worked for only around 4 hours on the HTML code and then tried to play with color and typography but I could not find the right look for it. I then decided to just start over and think about the color and type before I started the code.

It's also interesting thinking about the actual layout of the site, deciding what people should see first and what content you want them to focus on. While I think that I did a good job this week I think that in the future I will think about the layout, type, and color before I start to work on the HTML code. I think that drawing out the layout on a piece of paper beforehand will help me figure out how to write the style more efficiently.
