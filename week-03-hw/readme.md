# **Week Three Assignment** #

## *Introduction*

This week seemed to move much quicker and smoother for me. I was able to get my website up and running with minimal hiccups, I did not have to walk away from the computer at all. I think the main difference between my frustration last week and this week was that I found the [Atlassian website](https://answers.atlassian.com/) a little too late during the week 02 module. This week however if I had any problems it was just a click on my bookmark bar away from finding the solution. Because of this I did not post any issues on the course Wiki, but I will keep looking to see if any of my fellow classmates have any problems that I can help with.

## *Work*

The work this week came relatively easy as I think the html language is easily accessible online. I also think that I have figured out how the programs SourceTree, Atom, and GitHub all communicate with each other.

## *Future Excitement*

I am very excited about learning the language of html and also how to design the website with CSS. I was talking with my father who is a graphic design artist and he is also excited for me to learn this code as well. He said that while he learned a little bit on how to write html he deals more with the artistic side of it using Dreamweaver and Illustrator a lot. I hope that after this class maybe I can help my dad with at least introducing him to some of the programs we are using so he can further his knowledge as well.

I was also excited because I ran into some coding language in my Intro GIS class. While trying to get certain properties from an attribute table I was working on in ArcCatalog I was able to highlight and separate out the lines I needed to view by using a language that looked somewhat like the html code we are using. I think that this class will be a very valuable tool to help me figure out ArcGIS and ArcCatalog and how to move quickly in those applications.

## *Conclusion*
I am very excited to be able to create my own website from scratch. I have already come up with some sites that I want to create like:
1. A guide to backcountry skiing around Missoula
2. A source for links to different weather/snowfall predictions
3. A blog on the backpacking, climbing, skiing, and biking adventures that I go on
