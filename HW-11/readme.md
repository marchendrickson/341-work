# Parallax

This week was a nice break, with a lot less reading material and I was able to put in a little more thought into the design of my website. I have always loved using my own pictures in the websites I have been building and this was the perfect one to do that. Ever since the start of this class I have been looking at the sites that I visit the most and paying attention to what I like about the site. [Bikepacking.com](https://www.bikepacking.com) has the parallax design on their website and I always thought they made it look very unique and seamless.

# Problems

The one problem that I had this week was getting my image links set up in CSS. Luckily it didn't take long to realize that I just had to move my img directory into the same directory that my style.css was inside. I think that I was able to help a classmate: jaketheflare, who was having a similar problem to this. Overall this week went very smoothly for me and I am looking forward to maybe a creating a site like this past weeks as a portfolio for all of the images that I have taken.
